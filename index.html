<p>new crypto currency that you can mine ,
 need potential miners, 
and other competencies, only honest, nothing personal, 
decentralized    </p>

<p>note :
it is not created, and not used, yet.
this is only to tell miners and users what it will be like. 
and to wait until enough potential miners are there.</p>

<p>this one is for unchanging climate</p>

<p>if we bring it to its full value ,
by mining it and using it , 
we can unchange climate</p>

<p>you can make a DONATION before it is released,
and we will send you, after it is released,
one of our crypto dollar for climate change,
for each dollar you send, once conversed in CAD,</p>

<p>please note that we will use this to create it all, and it is not made yet. 
all the things needed for it, will be done one after the other.
you can send amount 1$CAD to 2000$CAD with
<a href="http://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/send-money-online">www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/send-money-online</a>
<a href="mailto:climatechangecryptodollars@gmx.com">climatechangecryptodollars@gmx.com</a></p>

<p>you can ask other miners to send a donation.</p>

<p>although we will do what we can to realize this,
to provide crypto dollars for each dollar you send,
and to be part of bringing it to its full value,
please consider your donation a support to the currency creation with no warranty. 
bringing it to the full value, will be a result of thousands of miners and users.</p>

<p>we will use those donation dollars to make the crypto dollars ,
and mine 0,4% of it, which at its full value,  will worth enough ,
and we will use it to unchange the climate,
doing all sorts of honest things to reverse or avoid effects of climate change. 
like cooling places, animal wellbeing,</p>

<p>it is a 12,500 crypto dollars rewards per block,
2.5 minutes mean block issuing,
limit cap at 50,000,000,000 ,
scrypt
dificulty retarget 2016 blocks
block halving at 2.25 years
around 25 years</p>

<p>decentralized
where the miners and users can have their opinions
and all is transparent and official,
like versions , mining pools, trade marks,  </p>

<p>we want to have a crypto dollar that worths between 1 and 10 USD,CAD,EUR,GBP,</p>

<p>we will use your donations for material and labour to make it,</p>

<p>and we will release it when there will be enough potential miners to make it stable.</p>

<p>YOU GET, if you want,
a dollars for each CAD that you send us as donation, we will use an official conversion, if you don't use CAD.</p>

<p>and a membership of the cooperative that will take care of all the rights, version releases, and trade marks, that could be used. </p>

<p>the 0,4% will not be held by this. which is only for agreements, rights, versions, and trademarks that could be used.
the 0,4% will be held by a company, that will be created specifically for that purpose, of keeping, this 0.4% and unchanging climate.</p>

<p>we encourage honest and decentralized activities,
for mining and all the rest.</p>

<p>our GOAL is to bring the 0.4% to its full value,
wich we think is the mining and production costs, and a reasonable premium for expectations,
to be able to unchanged climate, honestly and moderatly. while leaving space for the industry and the citizens,</p>

<p>it is not to change the factories,
only avoiding effects of climate change. </p>

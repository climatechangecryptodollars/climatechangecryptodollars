==========================

a crypto dollars for ungchanging cimate

it is mainly base as a clone of other and is to be separated as versions are brought.

the way the versions can be going, is decentralized, honest, with users opinions, 
decentralized in the way the users and miners participate, 
as a centralization issue happen the version could, with a majority or a big majority, stay away from it.
big majority, 65% to 85%, and consensus minus a reasonable portion, 85% to 92%, are prefered.   
on a close majority creativity could be used instead of convincing. 51% to 65%

the platform for checking majority on version can be built too.
it would be prferable for climate that the kWh spent on mining could rather be spent on ledger integrity checking,
the super hashing capabilities, asics and others, could be moderated with, 
using a variable of distance between mean hash, and number of miners in the, peer to peer, pool
 
scrypt based, that may change in versions, with a big majority  
for pool mining, peer to peer prefered
when considering new versions, you can consider : 
decentralization, 
results to the users and less to the kWh, 
climate, 
animal wellbeing, 
simplicity for the users, 
long, medium and short terms use, 
honestly used by users, 
reliability, before anonymity, 
stability 
light weight,
bringing the crypto dollars to its full value

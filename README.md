==========================

a crypto dollars for unchanging cimate

it is mainly base as a clone of other and is to be separated as versions are brought.
the licence is MIT, you can use it.  http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT


the way the versions can be going, is decentralized, honest, with users opinions, 
decentralized in the way the users and miners participate, 
as a centralization issue happen the version could, with a majority or a big majority, stay away from it.
big majority, 65% to 85%, and consensus minus a reasonable portion, 85% to 92%, are prefered.   
on a close majority creativity could be used instead of convincing. 51% to 65%

the platform for checking majority on version can be built too.
it would be prferable for climate that the kWh spent on mining could rather be spent on ledger integrity checking,
the super hashing capabilities, asics and others, could be moderated with, 
using a variable of distance between mean hash, and number of miners in the, peer to peer, pool
 
scrypt based, that may change in versions, with a big majority  
for pool mining, peer to peer prefered
when considering new versions, you can consider : 
decentralization, 
results to the users and less to the kWh, 
climate, 
animal wellbeing, 
simplicity for the users, 
long, medium and short terms use, 
honestly used by users, 
reliability, before anonymity, 
stability 
light weight,
bringing the crypto dollars to its full value

new crypto currency that you can mine ,
 need potential miners, and support.

note :
it is not created, and not used, yet.
this is only to tell miners and users what it will be like. 
and to wait until enough potential miners are there.




this one is for unchanging climate

if we bring it to its full value ,
by mining it and using it , 
we can unchange climate

 
you can make a DONATION before it is released,
and we will send you, the material related to that
after it is released,
 

please note that we will use this to create it all, and it is not made yet. 
all the things needed for it, will be done one after the other.
you can send amount 1$CAD to 2000$CAD with
www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/send-money-online
climatechangecryptodollars@gmx.com

you can ask other miners to send a donation.

although we will do what we can to realize this,
and to be part of bringing it to its full value,
please consider your donation a support to the currency creation with no warranty. 
bringing it to the full value, will be a result of thousands of miners and users.
  




we will use those donation dollars to make the crypto dollars ,
and mine 0,4% of it, which at its full value,  will worth enough ,
and we will use it to unchange the climate,
doing all sorts of honest things to reverse or avoid effects of climate change. 
like cooling places, animal wellbeing,


it is a 12,500 crypto dollars rewards per block,
2.5 minutes mean block issuing,
limit cap at 50,000,000,000 , means 4,000,000 blocks.
scrypt
dificulty retarget 2016 blocks
block halving at 2.25 years
around 25 years

decentralized
where the miners and users can have their opinions
and all is transparent and official,
like versions , mining pools, trade marks,  

we want to have a crypto dollar that worths between 1 and 10 USD,CAD,EUR,GBP,
before it will worth 0 to 1.
it is the users who will value it by using it.

we will use your donations for material and labour to make it,

and we will release it when there will be enough potential miners to make it stable.


YOU GET, if you want,
crypto currency , that you will be able to mine,
that is honest, and will be used for climate change

and a membership of the cooperative that will take care of all the rights, version releases, and trade marks, that could be used. 

the 0,4% will not be held by this. which is only for agreements, rights, versions, and trademarks that could be used.
the 0,4% will be held by a company, that will be created specifically for that purpose, of keeping, this 0.4% and unchanging climate.

we encourage honest and decentralized activities,
for mining and all the rest.
which means we will try to moderate industrial miners
relatively to the number of miners, to keep it decentralized.
you will be able to discuss the issues.


our GOAL is to bring the 0.4% to its full value,
wich we think is the mining and production costs, and a reasonable premium for expectations,
to be able to unchanged climate, honestly and moderatly. while leaving space for the industry and the citizens,

it is not to change the factories,
only avoiding effects of climate change. 

 
if you have issues with this offer,
please, informally, tell us,
we will really try to make this
honest , decentralized and easy to use,




donations  








here is guides to clone, 
following those , will get you there, with forums and wikis, 
you don't have to be experts to do it, 
but it is too much to do all ,
you are free not to let it take over your regular activities.
